### Project Idea: **Shopping Cart with Discounts**

**Description:** Build a simple shopping cart where users can add, remove, and update items. Each item has a name, price, and quantity. Use DOM manipulation, arrow functions, and methods like `map()`, `filter()`, and `forEach()` to perform the following:

- **Features**:
  1. Display the items in the cart dynamically on the page.
  2. Add new items to the cart with a form (name, price, quantity).
  3. Update the quantity of items already in the cart.
  4. Remove items from the cart.
  5. Show the total price of all items, and apply a discount if the total is above a certain amount.
  6. Filter items based on price range or quantity.
  7. Use `forEach()` to iterate through the cart and display each item's name, price, and quantity.
  8. Use `map()` to generate a new list of items with a discounted price if a certain condition is met.
  9. Use `filter()` to remove items that are no longer needed or meet certain criteria (e.g., quantity is zero).
  
This project allows you to work with dynamic UI updates, event listeners, and array methods!
