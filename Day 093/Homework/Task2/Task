2) Project: To-Do List Application
Key Features:
Add Tasks

Allow users to type a task and click "Add" to add it to the list.
Each task should have a checkbox to mark it as completed.
Delete Tasks

Users can delete tasks from the list with a "Delete" button next to each task.
Mark Task as Completed

Users can click a checkbox next to each task to mark it as completed. Completed tasks will have a different style (e.g., strike-through text).
Clear All Tasks

Add a button that allows users to remove all tasks at once.
Save Tasks to Local Storage

Save tasks in the browserâ€™s localStorage so that when the page is reloaded, the tasks remain.
Tools and Concepts:
Arrow Functions for handling events (e.g., adding and deleting tasks).
DOM Manipulation for creating, deleting, and modifying list items (document.createElement, appendChild, innerHTML, etc.).
Event Listeners for capturing user interactions (e.g., adding tasks or clicking checkboxes).
Local Storage for persistent data (optional, but great for practice).
