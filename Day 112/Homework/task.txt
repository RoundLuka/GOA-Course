### Project: Crypto Price Tracker

#### Overview
The Crypto Price Tracker app allows users to view current prices of various cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and more. You can extend this to include features like historical price data, percentage changes over time, and sorting by different criteria (e.g., highest to lowest price).

#### Requirements
- **HTML**: For creating a search input and a display area for the results.
- **CSS**: Basic styling for a clean and organized layout.
- **JavaScript**: Use `async/await` to fetch data and update the UI.
- **API**: Use a free cryptocurrency API like [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) or [CoinCap](https://coincap.io/).

#### Steps to Build
1. **Set Up the HTML Structure**:
   - Create an input field for users to search for specific cryptocurrencies.
   - Include a button to trigger the search.
   - Add a section to display the fetched cryptocurrency data (price, market cap, 24h change, etc.).

2. **Create the Fetch Function**:
   - Write an `async` function that takes the cryptocurrency name as an argument, calls the API, and retrieves the data.
   - Parse the JSON response and handle any potential errors.

3. **Render Data to the Page**:
   - Write a function to dynamically display the cryptocurrency data, such as name, price, 24-hour price change, and market cap.
   - Clear previous results on new searches.

4. **Add a Refresh Option** (Optional):
   - Set an interval to refresh the displayed prices every few seconds.

#### Example API Call
```javascript
const fetchCryptoData = async (crypto) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets?vs_currency=usd&ids=${crypto}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    renderCryptoData(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching crypto data:", error);
  }
};```
