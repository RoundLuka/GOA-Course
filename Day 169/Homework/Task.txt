**How to Implement Key Concepts:**

1. **useState**:
   - Use `useState` to manage the state of the product list (e.g., an array of product objects), the cart (e.g., an array of cart items), and user interactions such as quantity updates.
   
2. **useEffect**:
   - Use `useEffect` to load products from an API or a static file on initial render.
   - Use `useEffect` to load the saved cart from `localStorage` when the page first loads, ensuring the cart persists after page refresh.
   
3. **Custom Hooks**:
   - Create a custom hook like `useCart` to manage cart operations like adding an item, removing an item, and updating the quantity.
   
4. **Context API**:
   - Use Context API to manage the cart globally across different components. You can have a `CartContext` with actions such as `addToCart`, `removeFromCart`, `updateQuantity`, and the current cart state.
   - Use `useContext` to access and manipulate the cart data throughout your components.

**Suggested File Structure:**

```
src/
  components/
    ProductList.js
    ProductItem.js
    Cart.js
    CartItem.js
    CartSummary.js
    Checkout.js
  context/
    CartContext.js
  hooks/
    useCart.js
  App.js
  index.js
```
