Day 137
Project Idea: Task Manager
A task management app where users can create, edit, delete, and organize tasks into categories.

Features to Implement
Add Tasks

Allow users to input a task name and select a category (e.g., Work, Personal, Study).
Use state to manage the list of tasks.
Mark Tasks as Completed

Include a checkbox or button to mark tasks as complete. Use state to toggle the completion status.
Filter Tasks by Category

Provide a way to delete a task. Update the state to remove the task from the list.
Save and Load Tasks (Optional)

Use localStorage to save the tasks so that they persist between page reloads.
