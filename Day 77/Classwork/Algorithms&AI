Algorithms&AI Day 77:

Deepened my understanding of positional systems: hexadecimal, octal, decimal, and binary.
Recalled how to convert different positional systems to decimal by multiplying digits by their positional value, raised to the power of their position in the number.
Practiced converting numbers between different positional systems by dividing and recording remainders.
Learned a shortcut to convert one positional system to another when the target positional system is a power of the current one.
Recalled morse code and ASCII Table.
