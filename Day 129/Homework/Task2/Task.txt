Here’s a detailed description of your project without code:

### **Project: Simple Profile Card**

**Objective:**  
Create a React app using Vite that displays a list of user profiles. The app will use JSX and props for passing data between components.

---

### **Components:**

1. **App Component:**
   - Acts as the parent component.
   - Defines a static array of user profiles with details like name, age, and occupation.
   - Passes the array as a prop to the child components.

2. **ProfileList Component:**
   - Accepts the list of profiles as a prop from the `App` component.
   - Maps through the list to render individual `ProfileCard` components for each user.

3. **ProfileCard Component:**
   - A reusable component that accepts props for displaying user information (e.g., name, age, and occupation).
   - Displays the user details in a styled card layout.

---

### **Features:**

- **JSX**: Use JSX to structure the components.
- **Props**: Pass user data from the `App` component to `ProfileList`, and further to `ProfileCard`.
- **No State or Hooks**: All data will be static and passed down the component tree.

---

### **Styling:**

Use simple CSS to style the profile cards. You can include the styles in a `.css` file or use inline styles to keep the project simple.

---

### **How it Works:**

1. The `App` component defines the list of users and passes it to the `ProfileList` component.
2. The `ProfileList` component iterates over the user data and renders a `ProfileCard` for each user.
3. The `ProfileCard` displays the user’s details in a visually appealing layout.

---

### **Outcome:**

You’ll have a simple app that demonstrates:
- JSX usage for structuring the components.
- React components and their composition.
- Passing and utilizing props between components.
