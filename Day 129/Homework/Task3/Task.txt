Here’s another simple project idea that uses JSX, React components, and props without involving state or hooks.

---

### **Project: Product Showcase**

**Objective:**  
Create a React app using Vite that displays a grid of products. Each product will show details like its name, price, and a brief description, all passed as props.

---

### **Components:**

1. **App Component:**
   - Acts as the parent component.
   - Contains a static array of product data, including name, price, and description.
   - Passes this array as a prop to the `ProductList` component.

2. **ProductList Component:**
   - Accepts the product list as a prop from the `App` component.
   - Maps through the product data and renders a `ProductCard` for each product.

3. **ProductCard Component:**
   - A reusable component that accepts props for product details (e.g., name, price, and description).
   - Displays product information in a card-like format.

---

### **Features:**

- **JSX**: Use JSX to define the structure of the product cards and the product grid.
- **Props**: Pass product data from the `App` component down to `ProductList` and then to `ProductCard`.
- **No State or Hooks**: Data is static and handled through props only.

---

### **Styling:**

Use CSS to create a grid layout for the products. Each product card can have simple styling with a border, padding, and some spacing.

---

### **How it Works:**

1. The `App` component holds an array of product objects.
2. The `ProductList` component receives this array as a prop and uses `.map()` to render multiple `ProductCard` components.
3. The `ProductCard` component accepts product details as props and displays them in a structured layout.

---

### **Outcome:**

You’ll have a React app that:
- Uses JSX to define components.
- Demonstrates component composition and prop passing.
- Displays a clean, static product showcase.
